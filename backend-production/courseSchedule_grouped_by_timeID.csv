WBS can be used for project ‘GO’ or’ ‘NO GO’ initially especially during the tender/bidding stage by reviewing the Technical Application and Commercial Requirement for Feasibility and Viability Analysis respectively. If company has no experience in the technology required e.g. IoT/AI so it is a NO GO. Similarly, if company cannot afford the financial implied, also it is NO GO. WBS is the key to elaborate all the main parameters of projects as per the Triple Constraint:
1. Time by Planning/Scheduling which can also incorporate CPM - Critical Path Method manually or via software
2. Costing via BOM (Bill of Materials) & BOQ (Bill of Quantity)
3. Quality referring to Standards/Specifications as imposed. | As per Scope above, Time also driven by the project activities dominantly by Predecessor and Successor. Team member - has to understand the activities sequence in their profession in meeting the goal timely.
