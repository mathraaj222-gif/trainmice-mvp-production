The stigma of mental health is prevalent in Malaysia and according to the National Health and Morbidity Survey in 2019 report, half a million Malaysians were found to be experiencing symptoms of depression. Besides that, the onset of the pandemic has also led to an increase in cases of depression and anxiety. Ministry of Health (MOH) in 2021 has reported 85.5% of calls to government agencies since the pandemic were inquiring about mental health issues. Many of those calls required psychological and emotional support and counselling. MOH predicts that mental health is currently the 2nd highest health issue in Malaysia after heart disease. Challenges now arise when employed staff fail to have a healthy mental wellness which affects and decreases work productivity, work efficiency, increase the cases of being burn-out, low job satisfaction and a surge in detrimental mental stress in the long run. Rationale This interactive, fun, reflective workshop takes the participants through the fastest and easiest steps to regain control of their life, have good mental health and reduce harmful stress. Simultaneously work-life balance will impact various aspects of the participants life positively.

A recent survey conducted on 1,002 Malaysians concluded that 36% of women and 17% of men have experienced sexual harassment. From this, only 53% of victims reported or told someone about their harassment. The main worry not reporting sexual harassment is humiliation (54%), feeling alone and helpless (38%) and fear of consequences (26%). Companies need to consider the potential ramifications that can come from an employee sexually harassing another employee. Not only does this lead to a toxic culture and injury to reputation of the organisation, it can also result in loss of talents in the organisation and cause serious trauma to victims that could lead to mental health issues. It is important for organisations to have a robust sexual harassment policy including strong reporting mechanisms and prevention policy. On the other hand, employees need to know how to handle a situation if they are being harassed or seeing someone being harassed and be clear on the organisations policy, feel safe and confident in using the organisations reporting mechanism.

This transformation is driven by a confluence of regulatory mandates, investor expectations, and the undeniable economic opportunities presented by the green economy. Mandatory Disclosure for Publicly Listed Companies (PLCs): Bursa Malaysia's enhanced sustainability reporting requirements, aligned with global standards like TCFD, are being phased in. Critically, Malaysia's National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF) will mandate that the nation's largest publicly listed companies disclose their entire value chain's (Scope 3) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions starting 2027. This directly impacts large corporations and, by extension, places significant pressure on their SME suppliers to provide robust sustainability data. (Source: Eco-Business, July 2025; Incorp.asia, June 2025) SMEs as a Critical Link: While direct mandatory reporting for all SMEs is not yet universal, they are increasingly under pressure from large corporate clients, financial institutions, and global supply chains. Recognizing this, Malaysia has been proactive, becoming the first country globally to issue a simplified ESG disclosure guide for SMEs in supply chains (Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide - SEDG, launched by Capital Markets Malaysia in 2023). This initiative, alongside SME Corp Malaysia's ESG Quick Guide for MSMEs, aims to build capacity and align SMEs with global frameworks. (Source: Capital Markets Malaysia, 2023; SME Corp Malaysia, Feb 2025) Economic Opportunity & Value Creation: Beyond compliance, embracing ESG offers tangible benefits for Malaysian businesses: Enhanced Financial Performance: Studies indicate a positive correlation between strong ESG practices and financial performance, including Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) for Malaysian firms. (Source: EconJournals.com, 2024) Increased Valuation & Investment: Companies with robust ESG focus are favorably positioned for higher valuations. For instance, companies in the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia (F4GBM) Index have traded at 1.7x higher in price-to-book value. Malaysia saw USD 5.2 billion in green investments in Southeast Asia in 2022, signaling growing investor appetite. (Source: PwC Malaysia, 2023) Risk Mitigation & Resilience: Proactive ESG integration helps companies identify and mitigate environmental, social, and governance risks, enhancing long-term corporate longevity and operational efficiency. (Source: Ajinomoto.com.my, 2024; IMD Business School, 2024) Supply Chain Competitiveness: For SMEs, ESG adoption is increasingly vital to remain competitive within global supply chains, with 80% of Malaysian SMEs now aware of ESG and 60% adopting it (up from 41% awareness in a prior survey). (Source: Alliance Bank Malaysia, ESG 2.0 Report, 2023) This course is therefore not merely an educational offering; it is a strategic imperative designed to equip your leadership team with the foresight and capabilities to navigate this evolving landscape, unlock new value streams, and secure your organization's future competitiveness in Malaysia and globally.","This program is designed for a broad spectrum of professionals, from managers to C-suite executives, who are involved in or impacted by their organization's sustainability journey.

The global economy has given business broader access than ever before to markets all over the world. Goods are sold in more countries, in larger quantities, and in greater variety. But as the volume and complexity of global sales increase, so do possibilities for misunderstandings and costly disputes when sale contracts are not adequately drafted. ICC Incoterms rules on the use of domestic and international trade terms address this risk by facilitating the conduct of global trade. Reference to an incoterms rule in a contract for the sale of goods clearly defines the parties respective obligations regarding topics such as risk, cost and arrangement of transport & customs clearance and reduces the risk of legal complications. Since ICC first codified a set of standard trading terms as the Incoterms rules in 1936, this globally accepted contractual standard has been updated periodically to reflect the evolution of international trade. The Incoterms 2020 rules take account of the increased attention to security in the movement of goods, the need for flexibility in insurance coverage depending on the nature of goods and transport, and the call by banks for an on-board bill of lading in certain financed sales under FCA rule. Incoterms 2020 also offers a simpler and clearer presentation of all rules, featuring an expanded introduction and explanatory notes. Incoterms 2020 is also the first version off ICCs incoterms rules to include a horizontal presentation, grouping all like articles together and allowing users to clearly see differences in treatment of particular issues across the 11 incoterms rules. Incoterms rules define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers for the delivery of goods under sale contracts. They are the authoritative rules for determining how costs and risks are allocated to the parties. Incoterms rules are regularly incorporated into sale contracts worldwide and have become part of the daily language of trade. Incoterms 2020 contains use of the 11 incoterms trading terms. It takes into account the latest developments in commercial practice and updates and consolidates some of the former rules. All sales contracts should make reference to the incoterms 2020 rules as the latest version of the Incoterms rules.

Design thinking is a process for solving problems by prioritizing the organizations & consumer's needs above all else. It relies on observing, with empathy, how people interact with their environments, and employs an iterative, hands-on approach to creating innovative solutions. What is Strategic Design Thinking Towards Phenomenal T.E.A.M? In order to strive and prosper, organizations need to grow and adapt in the never-ending cycle of change. In order to evolve successfully, organizations need a strategy to manage opportunities and risks. Depending on the speed of change, emerging trends, and innovative ideas, senior leaders periodically formulate or refresh the overarching strategic vision and direction for the business. This strategic vision should explain where the organization is going and how it intends to get there while managing the chances that lie ahead on the journey. A strong team is the foundation of a high-performing business and a good team ethic can be held largely accountable for the success and smooth running of the organization. If employees do not gel and work well together, problems can arise, such as poor organization, missed deadlines, and conflict within the workplace. So, what can teams do to ensure that they are collectively productive and drive the company forward? All the activities above aimed at ensuring what the 8 Traits Successful Team Should Possesses. They communicate well with each other They communicate openly with each other, sharing their thoughts, opinions, and ideas with members of their team as well as taking into consideration what others have to say. Communication is essential for keeping track of progress and working together efficiently on tasks. Poor communication can lead to crossed wires, which can mean work is left incomplete/incorrect or conflicts can arise. They focus on goals and results They agree on and set team goals based on outcomes and results, rather than just on the amount of work being done. A clear plan can then be set about how they are going to achieve these objectives, as a group, as well as each individuals contribution. This provides them with clear direction and gives them something to aim for collectively. Everyone contributes their fair share Each member of the team contributes their fair share of the workload and fully understands what their responsibilities are and where they fit in with the running of the business. They feel a sense of belonging to the team, are committed to their work, and really care about the success of the company. They offer each other support Team members are always happy to assist others when they need a helping hand with work. Teams are often more productive when they are also offered support from the organization and access to the required resources. Team members are diverse Everyone is unique and will be able to offer their own experiences and knowledge that others may not possess. Diversity is needed so that all of the required skills are covered by somebody in the team and each individual can be assigned a particular role on the basis of their strengths and skills. A variety of personalities, age groups, cultures, etc. can also bring creativity and a broad range of ideas to the table. Good leadership A strong team usually has a leader that they trust and respect. This individual essentially works as the glue holding the team together and should be responsible for setting the pace, offers encouragement and motivation, and keeps all members of the team updated. Theyre organized The organization is essential for the smooth running of a business. Without it, the workplace can become chaotic and goals are unlikely to be achieved. Though each individual should be responsible for organizing their own workload, management should ensure that everything is running to plan and each member of the team is getting their work completed efficiently. Holding regular meetings can help to make sure that everyone is on the same page and deadlines are being met. They have fun It shouldnt be all work and no play! This can lead to burnout and a lack of productivity, so its important to inject a bit of enjoyment into working life. Teams who work particularly well together enjoy each others company and get together outside of the office from time to time to socialize and have some fun! Building a positive relationship with your colleagues can make for a much more relaxed environment and reduce conflict.",,"Knowles theory of andragogy is an attempt to develop a theory specifically for adult learning. Knowles emphasizes that adults are self-directed and expect to take responsibility for decisions. Adult learning programs must accommodate this fundamental aspect. Andragogy makes the following assumptions about the design of learning: (1) Adults need to know why they need to learn something (2) Adults need to learn experientially, (3) Adults approach learning as problem-solving, and (4) Adults learn best when the topic is of immediate value. In practical terms, andragogy means that instruction for adults needs to focus more on the process and less on the content being taught. Strategies such as case studies, role playing, simulations, and self-evaluation are most useful. Instructors adopt a role of facilitator or resource rather than lecturer or grader.
